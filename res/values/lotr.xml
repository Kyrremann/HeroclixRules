		<item>EPIC BATTLES\n
An epic battle is a HeroClix battle with a build total 400 or more points.</item>
		<item>EPIC ACTIONS AND EPIC TRAIT ABILITIES\n
In an epic battle, each player is granted one epic action each turn. An epic action is a special type of power action that can only be used to activate an epic trait ability (indicated by the #lotrbook# symbol on a character card). Unlike a power action, an epic action does not count against your action total and you cannot activate more than one epic trait ability each turn. A character cannot be given an epic action to activate any game effects that only require a power action. In this release, most epic trait abilities scale with the build total of the game.</item>
		<item>HORDE TOKENS\n
Horde tokens are bystander tokens marked with the #lotrm# symbol. Unlike other characters, identical horde tokens (those with the same set symbol and collector number) can share a single square on the battlefield by being stacked, and when stacked they can use special powers called horde powers. In this release, most horde powers scale with the number of tokens in the stack.\n
Stacking and unstacking horde tokens\n
Two or more identical friendly horde tokens in the same square is a stack. A stack can contain up to the maximum number of horde tokens indicated on the token next to the #lotrm# symbol. Horde tokens may be stacked during their placement in the starting area at the beginning of the game.
Stacks break away automatically. Stacks may add additional tokens to the stack while moving by moving through a square containing an identical horde token. Two stacks can also merge, but are still limited by the maximum stack size; any remaining tokens are placed in the last square the stack moved through before merging. When a single horde token moves into a stack, if the stack is already marked with an action token do not place a token on the stack.
You can move a horde token or stack to merge with another stack that already has two action tokens, even though no action token will be assigned.
If a stack has not yet been assigned an action token during a turn, an individual horde token in the stack may be given an action normally to unstack and move away.\n
Stacks on the battlefield\n
A stack of horde tokens is considered a single character for the purposes of movement, taking actions, making an attack, and being attacked. When a stack takes damage, regardless of the amount of damage taken, remove only one token from the stack. The token removed from the stack is defeated.</item>
		<item>HORDE POWERS\n
Horde powers are explained on the back of horde tokens. A horde token only possesses its horde power when it is the top token of a
stack. When the #lotrm# symbol appears in the text of a horde power, it refers to the current number of tokens in the stack. When the #lotrs#
symbol appears in the text of a horde power, it refers to the maximum number of tokens that stack can have. When the phrase “When #lotrm#” appears in the text of a horde power, it refers to a power than can only be used if the current number of tokens in the stack is the
maximum allowed.</item>
		<item>EPIC HORDES\n
In epic battles, defeated horde tokens are removed from the battlefield as normal but have a chance to return. At the beginning of each
player’s turn, that player may place horde tokens previously removed from the battlefield back onto the battlefield in that player’s starting
area. For each 100 points of the game’s build total, a player may return two horde tokens to the battlefield, to a maximum of 50 total
points of tokens. You may return them directly into a stack if the stack occupies an area they could be placed. In an epic battle, if a player
has only horde tokens remaining on the battlefield at the end of any turn, all of their horde tokens are immediately defeated and that
player loses the game.</item>
		<item>The One Ring\n
    Owner: Frodo, Frodo and Sam, Gollum, Mr. Underhill, Ringbearer, Sauron (Owners automatically roll a 6 when rolling to pick up The One Ring.)\n
Relic: 6 (This object can\'t be destroyed, picked up, moved or placed once on the map. Once per game per character, the character occupying the same square as this object may be given a power action and roll a d6 that can\'t be rerolled. On a roll of X, place this object on that character\'s character card, and the game effects listed on this card apply to that character. When that character is defeated, place this object in the square they last occupied. At the end of the game, if an opponent\'s character has this object on their card or all of your characters have been defeated, your opponent scores this object.)\n
The character controlling The One Ring can use Leadership, Probability Control and Stealth. At the end of each turn of the character controlling The One Ring, roll a d6 that can\'t be rerolled. On a roll of 1, the character places The One Ring in its square and is dealt 1 unavoidable damage.</item>
		<item>CAMPAIGN: THE BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH\n
Setting up a campaign battle\n
The setup section for each campaign battle specifies what map or maps should be used for the battle, and the point value of the
battle. Before setting up the first battle in a campaign, players should determine who will play Force A and who will play Force B for the
duration of the campaign; during each battle, each Force is required to include particular characters in their force, as explained in the
setup section, and the rest of the force can be made up of other characters from the Lord of the Rings HeroClix set or players\' HeroClix
collections. The setup section also contains any special rules that apply to the battle.\n
Treasures and reinforcements\n
The aftermath section of each campaign battle explains treasure and reinforcements a player can earn based on the outcome of a battle.
Treasures are awarded to the winner of the battle if they qualify, and can be used during any subsequent battle in the campaign, but only
one treasure effect can be used per battle. Reinforcements are awarded to the loser of the battle if they qualify, and must be used in the
next battle you play in the campaign.</item>
