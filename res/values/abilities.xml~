        <item>ADDITIONAL TEAM ABILITIES\nAdditional Team Ability (ATA) cards
			can be added to your force if the characters on your team meet the
			prerequisite listed on the card. Each ATA card indicates the cost per
			character that must be added to your force in order to use it in the
			game; all characters that meet the prerequisites must be assigned the
			ATA and your force’s Build Total is affected accordingly. ATA cards
			provide either different or additional team abilities to the
			qualifying characters on your force. These team abilities are
			possessed by the qualifying characters and can be used by wild cards
			(unless the ATA specifies otherwise). A force may only include one
			ATA card.</item>
        <item>BREAKING AWAY\n
			If a character occupying a square adjacent
			to one
			or more opposing characters is
			given an action and attempts to move,
			that
			character must successfully break away
			before it can move, as
			shown in Figure 8.
			To break away, roll a d6. On a result of 3 or
			less,
			that character fails to break away and can’t
			move; resolve the action
			immediately, including
			assigning that character any action tokens
			for
			that action. On a result of 4 or higher, that
			character succeeds in
			breaking away from all
			opposing characters adjacent to it. Regardless
			of any game effects, a d6 roll of 1 automatically
			results in a
			character failing to break away,
			while a d6 roll of 6 automatically
			results in a
			character succeeding in breaking away.
			Only one successful
			break away roll is
			required to move away from all adjacent
			opposing
			characters or other game effects
			that may require break away from that
			square.
			Once a character successfully breaks away, it
			can move through
			squares adjacent to every
			opposing character or game effect from which
			it broke away; but ends its movement as normal
			if it becomes adjacent
			to an opposing character
			that it did not break away from this action.</item>
        <item>CAPTURE\nGive this character a power action and make a close
			combat attack that deals no damage against a single opposing character
			with the #damage# or #tiny# damage symbol; targets that can use Phasing/Teleport or
			Plasticity modify their defense values by +2 for the attack. If	the attack succeeds, the target
			character is captured, and is called a captive.
			Remove a captive from the battlefield until it is rescued (see below).\n
			If this character has three captives, it can’t capture another
			character until at least one of the captives is
			rescued or released (see below), and it can’t make close combat attacks.
			If this character has any captives when it is knocked out,
			before removing this character from the game,  each captive is rescued
(see below) by the active player.
			\n\nReleasing captives.\n
			When it	occupies its starting area, this character can be given a power action
			to release one of its captives into an adjacent unoccupied square also
			in the starting area. A released captive is immediately defeated,
			and	this character’s player receives additional victory
			points for the released captive equal to 50 points or the
			released captive’s point value,	whichever is less.
			\n\nRescuing captives.\n Characters friendly to a
			captive can	attempt to rescue that captive. To do so, give a friendly
			character a	power action; it makes a close combat or
			ranged combat attack that deals
no damage against the target character that
			captured the captive. The target modifies
			its defense value by –1 for the attack for each of its
			captives. If the attack	succeeds the attacker chooses a friendly captive. The captive is rescued and
			put	into an	unoccupied square adjacent to the target of the
			attack. The rescued character now has one action token
regardless of how many it was previously assigned;
			 it can be given an action in the
			same turn it is rescued, but it is
			pushed normally.
			\n\nCountering Capture.\n
			roll 2d6; if the result of
			When Capture would be countered,
			the roll is not doubles, Capture is
			not countered. If Capture is
			countered, all captives of this
			character are rescued immediately.</item>
        <item>CARRY\nWhen moving as a result of being given an action, this character may carry one
			friendly character. When this ability is used, modify this character’s speed value by –2
			until the end of the action. The following characters can’t be carried: larger characters,
			multi-based characters, characters holding an object, and characters with any of the
			following combat symbols: 
			#transSpeed#, #flight#, #transFlight#, #transSwim#, #duo#. 
			To be carried, the friendly character
			must be adjacent to this character at the beginning of this character’s action. When
			this character ends its movement for the action, the carried character must be placed
			in a square adjacent to this character. While being carried, a carried character is not
			adjacent to any other character, nor can it draw a line of fire until placed at the end
			of this character’s movement for the action. A character which has been carried this
			turn can’t be given an action (other than a free action) until the beginning of the next</item>
        <item>COLOSSAL STAMINA\nThis character automatically breaks away and can use #imptar# #doubleoarr#. 
            When this character
			has two action tokens, it can be given a non-free action. If you do, after actions
			resolve deal it 1 unavoidable damage and do not clear action tokens from it at the
			end of the turn. This ability can’t be countered.</item>
        <item>COMBAT ABILITIES\n
			Capture
			Carry
			Colossal Stamina
			Duo Attack
			Flight
			Giant Reach
			Great Size
			Indomitable
			Move and Attack
			Multiattack
			Sharpshooter
			Swim
			Transporter</item>
        <item>DUO ATTACK\nGive this character a power action to make a duo attack. 
            This character possesses #lightning#
			for this action. It makes a close or ranged combat attack as a free action. After the
			attack resolves, it may make an additional close or ranged combat attack as a free
			action with its damage value modified by -1 to a minimum of 1.</item>
        <item>FIRST-ROUND IMMUNITY\nDuring the first round of the game,
			characters that have not been given an action, placed, or moved can
			not be targeted by opposing characters, knocked back, attacked, or
			damaged, unless a game effect that does so specifically states that
			it occurs at the beginning of the game.</item>
        <item>FLIGHT\nThis character can use #impmov# #ignet#, #ignht#, #ignobt#, #doubleoarr#. An elevated character using this ability
			ignores knock back
			damage if its knock back path crosses the boundary to a lower level.</item>
        <item>GIANT REACH\nThis character ignores opposing characters’
			Plasticity and adds 1 to its d6 roll when
			breaking away. When this
			character is given a move action it can use the
			Carry
			ability. When
			this character is given an action that includes a close combat
			attack, all
			squares within a range of 2 and line of fire are
			considered adjacent. This
			ability can’t
			be countered.</item>
        <item>GREAT SIZE\nThis character can use #impmov# #ignet#, #ignht#, #ignobt#, #doubleoarr# and can’t be knocked back. When this
			character makes a close combat
			attack, it may target characters on
			higher elevations.
			This character may draw lines of fire (and have lines
			of fire drawn to
			it) as if the
			character occupied the elevation equal
			to or greater than the elevation it
			occupies,
			using the elevation level
			with the least restrictive line of fire.
			This ability
			can’t be
			countered.</item>
        <item>GRENADES\n
			FRAG (2 damage): A hit character in the target square
			is dealt 1 additional damage. Each other hit character is knocked
			back from the target square.\n
			FLASHBANG (no damage): The target
			square
			for this grenade can be within 8 squares. Place an action token
			on
			all hit characters that have zero tokens.\n
			PLASMA (no damage): Mark
			a hit character in the target square. At the beginning of your next
			turn, deal 2 damage to the character marked in this way and 1 damage
			to all adjacent characters that are friendly to that character.\n
			THERMITE (1 damage): Destroy up to 3 squares of blocking terrain or
			walls adjacent to the target square.\n
			SMOKE (1 damage): Place a
			hindering terrain marker in the target square and up to two adjacent
			squares. Remove them at the beginning of your next turn. Characters
			occupying squares with these markers can\'t make ranged attacks.\n
			INK (1 penetrating damage): Place a hindering terrain marker in the
			target square. At the beginning of your next turn, deal 1 additional
			penetrating to each character occupying the target or adjacent
			squares, then remove the marker.\n</item>
        <item>IMPROVED MOVEMENT &amp; TARGETING\n
		    Improved Movement\n
		    A character with the #impmov# symbol uses the effects indicated by its character card. Improved Movement activates whenever the character moves.\n
		    Improved Targeting\n
	            A character with the #imptar# symbol uses the effects indicated by its character card. Improved Targeting activates whenever the character draws a line of fire.\n\n
		    #ignet#: #impmov# - Ignores elevated terrain; #imptar# - Ignores elevated terrain.\n

        <item>INDOMITABLE\nThis character can use Willpower.</item>
        <item>KNOCK BACK\nWhen a player rolls doubles on a successful attack
			roll, the target is knocked back after any damage
			taken from the
			attack is applied. Knock back
			represents a character being thrown
			backward by
			the force of an attack. Certain game effects might
			knock
			back a character or allow a character to
			ignore knock back (Examples:
			Powers: Charge;
			Abilities: Great Size; Other effects: Multi-base
			characters). Check for those game effects before
			applying knock back.
			A knocked back character is moved back
			one square for each 1 damage
			taken. Move the
			character in a straight line away from the attacking
			character—called the knock back path—even if
			that path is on a
			diagonal. If multiple characters
			take damage from a game effect that
			causes
			knock back, resolve the knock back starting with
			the character
			farthest from the attacker.
			If the knock back path is not along a
			straight
			horizontal or vertical line, then the knock back path
			follows
			the diagonal line starting with the square
			that is on the opposite
			side of the target from the
			attacker, in both the vertical as well as
			horizontal
			direction.
			Movement along a knock back path ignores
			the
			effects of hindering terrain and objects on
			movement.\n\n
			KNOCK BACK
			DAMAGE\nA character’s knock back path can’t continue
			beyond a square
			that blocks movement, elevated
			terrain of a higher elevation or the
			edge of the
			map. If it would do so, the character’s knock back
			path
			ends in the square before its path would
			cross into any of these
			areas, and the character
			is dealt 1 damage, as shown in Figure 10.
			This
			damage dealt is called knock back damage. It can
			be reduced as
			normal and is applied separately
			and after damage dealt by the
			attacker. Knock
			back into a terrain feature does not destroy it.
			If the
			knock back path would cross a
			square occupied by another character,
			put the
			knocked back character in the last unoccupied
			square adjacent
			to the square occupied by
			the other character. Stopping in this way
			does not deal damage to either character.\n\n
			KNOCK BACK OFF ELEVATED
			TERRAIN\nWhen a character is knocked across the
			rim of elevated
			terrain (i.e.: from a higher elevation to a lower
			elevation (see Line
			of Fire: The Rim, p. 14), the knock back path
			ends in the first square
			of a lower elevation and that character is
			dealt 2 knock back damage.
			If the first square of a lower elevation
			along the knock back path is
			occupied by another character, the knock
			back path ends in the last
			square of the higher elevation and that
			character is not dealt knock
			back damage. Characters using the Flight
			ability (see the Powers and
			Abilities Card) which are knocked back
			off of elevated terrain are not
			dealt knock back damage, though they
			still end their knock back path
			in the first empty square of a lower
			elevation.</item>
        <item>MERG\nWhen this character is adjacent to other friendly characters that each represent
			one distinct qualifying character listed on a Duo character’s character card and all
			of them have no action tokens, give this character a free action to replace all of
			them with that Duo character, the same number of clicks from its starting line as
			this character. The combined point value of the qualifying characters must be equal
			to or greater than the point value of the Duo character (unless that Duo character
			previously used the Split ability to be replaced by these same characters). The Duo
			character can’t use the Split ability this turn. This ability can’t be countered.</item>
        <item>MOVE AND ATTACK\nThis character can use Hypersonic Speed if it
			is not adjacent to an opposing
			character when given the power action,
			but its attack value is modified by -2.</item>
        <item>MULTIATTACK\n
			Once per turn, give this character a power action. It can be given any two actions
			as free action. Resolve the first free action before giving it the second. Modify this
			character’s damage value by -1 to a minimum of 1. This ability can’t be countered.</item>
        <item>MULTI-BASE CHARACTERS\n
            Most HeroClix characters are mounted on a
base that takes up one square of the map; these
are called single-base characters. A multi-base
character is mounted on a base that takes up
more than one square. A multi-base character
occupies all of the squares each of its bases
occupies and is adjacent to each square adjacent
to the squares its bases occupies, as shown in
Figure 15. Squares on opposite sides of a multi-
base character are not adjacent to each other.
	 A multi-base character that occupies two bases
is a peanut base. Peanut bases can be oriented in
any two adjacent squares. A multi-base character
that occupies more than two squares is a larger
base character. A larger base character is only
allowed to be oriented horizontally or vertically;
it cannot be oriented diagonally. Multi-base
characters can’t be carried or knocked back.
They can’t be placed by the Telekinesis power.
\n\n
MOVING MULTI-BASE CHARACTERS\n
When a multi-base character moves, choose any
square occupied by the multi-base character to begin
the movement. The character moves as if it is a single
base character moving from the chosen square and
follows all movement rules accordingly. Multi-base
characters must always end movement so that all of
its bases occupy legal, adjacent squares. No part
of the base may be moved more squares than the
one chosen for the move. If any square a multi-base
character occupies is hindering terrain, the character
is considered to occupy hindering terrain when it
begins to move, no matter which square it starts from.
\n\n
ATTACKING AND MULTI-BASE CHARACTERS\n
When attacking or drawing a line of fire to or from a
multi-base character, the player attacking or drawing
the line of fire can choose to attack or draw the line
of fire to or from any one square occupied by the
multi-base character. When attacking a character
on the same elevation, a line of fire to another
character will be blocked if it crosses any square
occupied by a multi-base character. One square of
a multi-base character will not block the line of fire
from another square it occupies. When a multi-base
character’s attack or line of fire involves multiple
targets, each target may have a line of fire drawn
from a different square, as long as each square
is one that the multi-base character occupies.</item>
        <item>PREPARING FOR BATTLE\nOnce all players have assembled their
			forces, there are still a few steps to go through before the battle
			can begin.\n
			STEP 1: REVEAL FORCES AND ESTABLISH THE FIRST PLAYER\n
			All
			players reveal their completed forces. Then, each player rolls 2d6
			(reroll ties). The player with the highest total result gets to
			choose who will be the first player. When playing with more than 2
			players, the player with the next highest total gets to choose who
			will be the second player, and so on.
			Each player turns the combat
			dial of each of his or her characters to the
			starting position. The
			starting position has a click number marked
			“1” and/or is the click to
			the right of the green line.
			Once a character’s combat dial has been
			turned to its starting position,
			players can turn the dial only when
			directed to do so by a game
			effect, such as taking damage or healing.
			One way to build your force is to start with a particular strategy.
			For
			example, you can create a force that specializes in ranged combat
			attacks or mind control or that inflicts damage by throwing objects.
			But don’t make your force too specialized! For each strategy, there
			is a counter-strategy, so it’s important to make your force diverse
			enough to handle a variety of threats.\n
			STEP 2: CHOOSE MAP AND
			STARTING AREAS\n
			The first player chooses the map where the
			game will
			occur. After the first player chooses
			the map, the player to his or
			her left chooses the
			starting area—an area of squares inside a purple
			boundary line—where he or she will set up his
			or her force. If there
			are more than two players,
			continue clockwise around the table until
			everyone
			has chosen a different starting area. In two-player
			games, the
			chosen starting areas must always
			be on opposite sides of the map. If
			either player’s
			force will not fit within the purple lines, all
			starting
			areas increase by one row and one column but
			cannot overlap
			another player’s starting area.
			Starting areas can be extended until
			each player’s
			force will fit in their respective starting area.\n
			STEP
			3:
			PLACE CHARACTERS\n
			The first player places all of the characters on
			his
			or her force on the map in his or her starting area.
			The player to
			the
			first player’s left then places
			all of his or her characters in his
			or
			her starting
			area. If there are more than two players, continue
			clockwise around the table until all players have
			placed their forces
			in their starting areas.
			You will constantly pick up your characters
			during a game to look at or turn their dials; you may
			want to mark the
			square your character was in so
			that you always return it to the
			correct square.
			Once Steps 1–3 are complete, play begins
			with the first
			player.</item>
        <item>RAM\nGive this character a move action; it may only move along a
straight horizontal or vertical path and it can\'t change its
orientation. After actions resolve, make a close combat attack as a
free action that targets all opposing characters that were moved
through. Each hit character is dealt this character\'s damage value
and deal this character 1 unavoidable damage for each 100 points
of characters dealt damage during the movement.</item>
        <item>ROLLING 2 AND 12:\nCRITICAL MISSES AND CRITICAL HITS\n
			If you
			roll
			a two (two 1s) on an attack roll, you
			automatically miss the
			target,
			even if your Attack
			Total would allow you to hit the target.
			This is
			called a
			critical miss. Immediately deal the attacking
			character
			1
			unavoidable damage; this represents a weapon
			backfire or
			your
			character straining or wounding itself
			during the action. This
			unavoidable damage is not part
			of the attack.
			If you roll a 12 (two 6s)
			on an attack roll, you
			automatically hit the target, regardless of
			what you
			needed to roll to hit. This is called a critical hit. A
			critical
			hit increases damage dealt by 1 to each successfully
			hit
			target.
			When using the Support power (see the Powers
			and Abilities
			Card) and a critical miss is rolled for the
			attack roll, the attempt
			is an automatic miss and the
			target is dealt 1 unavoidable damage
			instead. If a
			critical hit is rolled for the attack roll, the attempt
			is an
			automatic hit, and you add 1 to the amount of damage
			healed by
			the target.</item>
        <item>ROLLING DOUBLES\nSee knockback.</item>
        <item>SHARPSHOOTER\nThis character possesss #imptar# #ignoc#, #doubleo#.</item>
        <item>SPLIT\nSplit
Give this character a power action if it has no action tokens. Replace this character with one or more qualifying characters each from a different entry listed on this character’s character card. The qualifying replacement character(s) must have either qualifying name and total no more than this character’s point value (unless those characters previously used the Merge ability to be replaced by this character). Replacement character(s) are assigned an action token and can’t be given an action this turn. Replacement character(s) begin a number of clicks from their starting lines equal to the number of clicks from this character’s starting line. This ability can’t be countered.</item>
        <item>SWIM\nThis character can use #impmov# #ignwt#.</item>
        <item>THE RULE OF THREE\nWhenever the sum of all modifiers applied to
			a
			single combat value is greater than +3 or less
			than -3, the sum of
			all modifiers is instead +3 or
			-3, respectively. All modifiers
			continue to apply to
			the combat value; only their sum is changed. This
			rule only applies to modifiers, not to replacement
			values. Replacement
			values can alter the
			printed combat value by more than 3 before any
			modifiers apply, with modifiers still limited to a
			net modification of
			3 on the replaced value.</item>
        <item>TEAM DIALS\n
		    Characters with the new Team combat icon symbol are Teams.  A Team has locations on it where figures from corresponding SwitchClix bases can be placed.  Each such character is called a team member.\n\n
		    FORCE CONSTRUCTION\n
			When you add a team to your force, you must pay the cost of the team.  For each team member that begins the game attached to the team, increase the point value of the team by 5 points.  A team must have a minimum of 3 characters (15 points) attached at any given time unless a game effect says otherwise.  Each team member attached to the team must have an asset ability listed on its character card whose icon matches the icon of the asset ability listed on the team’s character card.  Team members begin the game attached to the team while their SwitchClix bases may be included in your sideline.  Teams and team members can’t be assigned resources, can’t roll to pick up a relic, can’t become a pilot of a vehicle unless a game effect specifies otherwise.\n
			The Team combat icon symbol also grants the following abilities.  None of these abilities can be countered.  If this character uses Earthbound/Neutralized, it can still use these abilities:\n\n
			WORKING TOGETHER\n
			Give this character a power action and it may be given one action as a free action for every 100 points or fraction thereof of its point value.  These free actions may be used for any action, but you may only give the character up to 1 move action, up to 1 power action, up to 1 close combat action, and up to 1 range combat action.  Any number of these free actions may be used to make either a close or ranged combat attack.\n\n
			PRACTICED MANEUVERS\n
			This character can use Improved Momvement: Elevated and Characters.  This character may occupy squares of different elevation.\n\n
			SOLO ADVENTURE\n
			Give this character a power action, remove any team member from the team and insert it into its SwitchClix base.  The character is placed adjacent to the team on its SwitchClix base turned to the first click number color that matches the team’s current click color.  If removing the team member from the team would mean that the total point value of removed team members exceeds the point value of the team, then the team member can’t be removed.  When a removed character has multiple starting lines, its point value and starting line are considered to be the first starting line other than an orange starting line preceding the click it is on when placed on the map.\n\n
			A TEAM REUNITED\n
			Give this character a power action when it is adjacent to a character that was a team member earlier in the game.  Remove the character from its SwitchClix base, place it on the team and remove the SwitchClix base from the map.\n\n
			TEAM COORDINATION\n
			When counting characters for a themed team do not count the team as a character, instead each team member counts as a character.  At the beginning of the game when a team is part of a themed team, choose: Themed Team Probability can be used normally or it can’t be used and the team can use Probability Control.</item>
        <item>THEMED TEAMS\nThemed teams are forces of HeroClix characters in
			which all characters share at least one common keyword among the
			keywords listed on their character cards. Keywords are not case
			sensitive. Bystander tokens can be included in your force although
			they do not have keywords, but they are not considered “characters”
			for the purpose of bonuses or counting characters for qualifications
			described below.
			A keyword can either be generic or named. Any keyword
			that is not generic is a
			named keyword. If
			the shared keyword is a
			generic keyword, your force
			must include at
			least three characters for
			each 300 points (or
			fraction thereof) of
			the game’s build total to be
			considered a themed
			team. If the shared
			keyword is a named keyword,
			your force must
			include at least two
			characters for each 300 points (or
			fraction
			thereof) of the game’s
			build total to be considered a themed
			team.\n\n
			THEMED TEAM BENEFITS\nPlayers using a themed team receive a
			number of
			benefits:
			When rolling to establish who will choose to be the
			first
			player, the
			player using a themed team gets a +1 bonus to the
			roll for
			each
			character (excluding bystander tokens) on that player’s
			force.
			The player of a themed team may choose one target battlefield
			condition
			to be canceled including his or her own. This choice is made
			when
			battlefield conditions are revealed.
			Any character on a themed
			team can use Probability Control. This use of
			Probability Control does
			not count towards any other game effects
			that reference the use of
			Probability Control (such as meeting
			prerequisites for feats). If the
			shared keyword is a generic keyword,
			the team can use this once per
			game for each 300 points (or fraction
			thereof) of the game’s build
			total. If the shared keyword is a named
			keyword, the team can use this
			two times per game for each 300 points
			(or fraction thereof). The
			character using Probability Control in
			this way:\n
			• Must possess the
			keyword that establishes the theme of the force.\n
			• Must not have
			already taken a non-free action this turn.\n
			• Must not be able to use
			Probability Control through another game
			effect.\n
			• Must not have used
			Probability Control in this way earlier in the
			turn.\n
			• Must be given
			an
			action token (this does not affect your Action
			Total for the
			turn).\n</item>
        <item>THROW A GRENADE\n Give the character a power action, decrease the number of grenades in your
			grenade pool by 1 (if greater than 0), and choose a type of grenade listed on
			the character’s character card. Choose a target square within 5 squares and line
			of fire and for this attack, this character can use #imptar# #chara#. Make a ranged combat
			attack targeting all characters occupying or adjacent to the target square. Deal
			damage to each character hit based only on the type of grenade chosen.</item>
        <item>TINY SIZE\n
			Modify this character’s defense value by +1 against ranged combat attacks. A friendly character that is larger and adjacent can use the Carry ability to carry up to one #tiny# character, regardless of its other combat symbols, does not reduce its speed value for doing so and can continue to use the Carry ability if it can normally. This ability can’t be countered.</item>
        <item>TRANSPORTER\nAlso called the reversed speed. A character with a
			speed symbol
			printed in reverse (#speed#, #flight#, or #swim#) is a
			transporter,
			and has the Carry ability and the Move and Attack
			ability. If it has
			the #flight# speed symbol, it also has the Flight
			ability, and if it
			has the #swim# speed symbol, it also has the Swim
			ability.</item>
        <item>VEHICLES\n
		    A vehicle is a HeroClix character marked with the #vehicles# defense symbol. Vehicles can be played in one of two modes, 
		    Autopilot and Piloted, each with its own point value. You must choose which mode the vehicle will be played in when building your force. 
		    A vehicle can use the Carry ability, but does not modify its speed value from it and can carry up to the maximum number of friendly 
		    characters indicated on the vehicle\'s base next to the #standingMan# symbol. When using the Carry ability, vehicles ignore the combat symbols of friendly characters. 
		    Vehicles can use #impmov# #ignht# #chara#. Vehicles can make ranged combat attacks against opposing characters to whom it can draw a line of ﬁre, even when it is 
		    adiacent to an opposing character. A vehicle can\'t be dealt damage through the Mastermind power.
		    \n
		    AUTOPILOTED VEHICLES\n
		    When a vehicle in Autopilot mode is given an action, after actions resolve, if the vehicle made an attack during that action, deal it l unavoidable damage.
		    \n
		    PILOTED VEHICLES\n
		    A friendly character adiacent to a vehicle in Piloted mode can be given a free action to become the vehicle\'s pilot 
		    (unless the character is a vehicle or can use Battle Fury). A vehicle in Piloted mode may only have one pilot at a time. 
		    A character who becomes a vehicle\'s pilot is removed from the battlefield and placed on the vehicle\'s character card; all 
		    of a pilot\'s powers and abilities are ignored, unless a game etfect specifies it activates when the character is a pilot. 
		    When a character becomes its pilot, the vehicle may not be given an action until your next turn. A vehicle may have 
		    additional traits called Pilot Abilities. When a pilot matches any prerequisite listed for a pilot ability, the vehicle possesses that trait.
		    A vehicle\'s pilot can eject from the vehicle and return to the battlefield by giving the vehicle a free action, 
		    as long as the character did not become the vehicle\'s pilot during the some turn. When a pilot ejects, place the character in a square 
		    adjacent to the vehicle (or the closest unoccupied square it can legally occupy); the character may not be given a non-free action this turn and it may not be 
		    given an action to become this vehicle\'s pilot this turn. The time between a character becoming a pilot and being ejected is called a trip. 
		    During a game, different characters may take a trip in a given vehicle. The same character might take multiple trips with a vehicle. Once per trip, the 
		    vehicle may be given a free action to replace its combat values with any or all of the combat values of its pilot until the beginning of your next turn.
		    When you do, the pilot is dealt 1 unavoidable 
		    damage at the beginning of your next turn even it it is no longer the pilot of that vehicle. lf the pilot can now use Battle Fury, it immediately ejects.
		    When a vehicle in Piloted mode does not have a pilot and is given a non-free action, after actions resolve, deal it l unavoidable damage.\n
		    WRECKED VEHICLES\n
		    When a vehicle is knocked out it is wrecked. A wrecked vehicle is defeated but its figure remains on the battleﬁeld; all ol its 
		    powers, abilities, and values are ignored and it is considered an ultra-heavy obiect until the end of the game. 
		    lf a vehicle has a pilot when it is wrecked, the pilot immediately ejects into a square of its controller\'s choosing and is dealt l unavoidable damage.\n
		    RAM\n
		    Some vehicles have the Ram combat ability.</item>
        <item>WILD CARDS\nWild card team abilities allow a character to use
			any team ability possessed by any friendly character on the
			battlefield. A character that possesses a wild card team ability is
			called a “wild card.” Although wild cards can use team abilities,
			they do not possess the copied team ability nor do they possess the
			team symbol. Certain game effects only apply to characters that
			possess a particular team ability or symbol – wild cards would not
			qualify for these through using another characters’ team ability.
			Some team abilities are labeled as “Uncopyable.” A wild card
			character cannot use an uncopyable team ability from another
			character.
			A wild card may be given a free action to use a single team
			ability
			that a friendly character possesses. A wild card may be given
			this
			free action more than once per turn (this is an exception to the
			rule
			that characters can’t activate the same free action more than
			once
			per turn). A wild card begins the game not using any other
			character’s team ability. A wild card may change the team ability it
			is using to any team ability possessed by a friendly character (or no
			team abiliy) with each free action it is given.
			A wild card retains
			its most recently used team ability until it is
			given a free action to
			use another team ability (or choose no team
			ability) or until after
			the resolution of an action during which all
			friendly characters whose
			team ability the wild card is using are
			defeated or removed from the
			battlefield. If a copied team ability
			includes a “once per turn” or
			“once per game” clause, a wild card
			follows that clause each time it
			uses the team ability as if it were
			using it consistently the entire
			game. A wild card activating Pulse
			Wave can continue to use a copied
			team ability even if the team
			abilities of the friendly characters are
			being ignored.</item>
