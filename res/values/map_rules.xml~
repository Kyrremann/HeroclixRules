    <string-array name="map_rules">
        <item>BLOCKING TERRAIN\nBlocking terrain represents areas and objects
			on the map with the potential to completely impede a character’s
			movement and line of fire. Any line of fire or path of movement that
			crosses blocking terrain is labeled a “blocked” line of fire or path
			of movement, the movement cannot happen and the line of fire is not
			able to be drawn through this terrain.\n
			• Adjacency: Squares on opposite sides of blocking terrain are not
			adjacent. Two squares of blocking terrain adjacent to each other
			across the diagonal of an intersection would prevent adjacency
			between the two squares on the opposite side of that intersection.\n
			• Movement: Blocking terrain prevents movement. Characters can’t move
			into or through blocking terrain.\n
			• Line of Fire: Blocking terrain prevents a line of fire from being
			drawn between two squares. Any line of fire crossing a square of
			blocking terrain is blocked (except for a line of fire between two
			characters on an elevation higher than that of outdoor blocking
			terrain).</item>
        <item>CLEAR, HINDERED, OR BLOCKED\nEvery line of fire or path of
			movement you can draw is either clear, hindered, or blocked. Clear is
			less restrictive than hindered, which is less restrictive than
			blocked, which is the most restrictive. When a line of fire or path
			of movement crosses several different types of terrain, it is the
			most restrictive
			type of line of fire or path of movement in any
			square it crosses. For example, a line of fire
			crossing both hindering and blocking terrain is a
			blocked line of fire.</item>
        <item>CLEAR TERRAIN\nClear terrain is open space with no obstructions
			or terrain or debris markers, such as a rooftop, a park, or an empty
			street. Any line of fire or path of movement that crosses only clear
			terrain is a “clear” line of fire or path of movement.\n
			• Movement: Clear terrain does not impede movement in any way.\n
			• Line of Fire: Clear terrain does not impede line of fire in any way.</item>
        <item>DEBRIS MARKERS\nWhen a square of blocking terrain is destroyed,
			place a debris marker in the square; this marker
			represents the rubble left behind by the destruction
			of the blocking terrain. A debris token is a type of
			special terrain marker. A debris token is a hindering
			terrain marker with the special property that it can
			be placed on blocking terrain. When placed on
			blocking terrain that square is hindering terrain
			instead of blocking terrain. Debris tokens can be
			placed on terrain other than blocking terrain as well,
			but those squares are considered hindering terrain
			in addition to their normal properties.</item>
        <item>DESTROYING BLOCKING TERRAIN\nA square of blocking terrain can be
			destroyed by a
			single attack that deals at least 3 damage. When
			a character attacks blocking terrain, the attack
			automatically succeeds. A close combat attack
			can be used to destroy a square of blocking terrain
			adjacent to the attacker. A ranged combat attack
			can be used to destroy a square of blocking terrain
			by drawing a line of fire to the center of the square of
			blocking terrain; the line of fire is not blocked by the
			target square in this instance.</item>
        <item>DESTROYING WALLS\nA close combat attack can be used to destroy a
			wall segment along the edge of the square the
			character occupies. A ranged combat attack can
			be used to destroy a wall segment but only if a
			single line of fire can be drawn to the center of the
			square on the other side of the wall segment that
			also crosses the other square along the same edge
			as the wall segment. The squares on each side of
			the wall must be within the attacking character’s
			range. All other requirements
			for destroying a wall are the
			same as those for destroying blocking terrain.
			When a wall is destroyed, place debris
			markers in those clear terrain squares
			adjacent to both sides of the destroyed wall,
			as shown in Figure 12, to represent the debris
			remaining after the wall’s destruction.</item>
        <item>ELEVATED TERRAIN\nElevated terrain represents terrain at
			different levels
			above the battlefield. Elevated terrain can contain
			other kinds of terrain like hindering or blocking which
			would have the properties of both elevated terrain
			and the other terrain. Elevated terrain itself can’t be
			destroyed. Characters, objects, and terrain features
			on elevated terrain are considered elevated and
			their level of elevation is the level of the elevated
			terrain they occupy. Characters, objects, and terrain
			that are not elevated are grounded or at elevation
			level 1. Characters at different elevation levels are
			not considered adjacent for any game effect. A
			character at a lower elevation is adjacent to elevated
			terrain when the only reason the square in question
			is not adjacent is because it is a higher elevation.</item>
        <item>HINDERING TERRAIN\nHindering terrain represents an area
			containing trees, furniture, debris, objects, and other similar items
			that might obstruct both a character’s line of fire and movement.
			Close combat attacks are not prevented by hindering terrain. Any line
			of fire or path of movement that crosses hindering terrain (including
			the square occupied by the target) is labeled a “hindered” line of
			fire or path of movement. A hindered line of fire is treated as a
			clear line of fire for the purposes of powers and abilities that
			require a “clear” line of fire, with the additional effects below.\n
			• Movement: Hindering terrain impedes movement. A character that
			crosses from terrain that is not hindering for movement into a square
			that is hindering for movement must stop moving. Any character that
			begins its movement in hindering terrain halves its speed value
			before moving.\n
			• Line of Fire: Hindering terrain impedes line of fire. If a line of
			fire between two characters is hindered, modify the target’s Defense
			Value by +1 for the attack, unless the only square of hindering
			terrain crossed is occupied by the attacker.</item>
        <item>LINE OF FIRE\nIf a line of fire between two characters on the
			same
			elevation crosses elevated terrain of a higher level,
			it is blocked. The line of fire between characters
			on the same elevation is not blocked by elevated
			terrain of that level or lower, though other terrain at
			that elevation level crossing the line of fire affects it
			normally.</item>
        <item>LINE OF FIRE ACROSS
			INTERSECTION POINTS\nWhenever a character’s line of fire crosses exactly
			through an intersection point, treat the point as the less
			restrictive of the two squares that touch that point but
			are not otherwise in the line of fire.</item>
        <item>LINE OF FIRE: THE RIM\nA square with a red line running through
			it with an
			elevation of a lower level sharing an edge with it
			is considered “the rim”. Characters on the lower
			elevation are not adjacent to the rim any more than
			they are adjacent to a character occupying the
			square that the rim borders. A line of fire between
			characters on different elevations is blocked by:\n
			• Blocking terrain on the same elevation as
			the character on the lower elevation.\n
			• Elevated terrain of any level higher than the
			level occupied by the character on the lower
			elevation, except the square occupied by
			the character on the higher elevation.\n
			• #giant# or #colossus# characters.
			A line of fire between characters on
			different elevations is not affected by
			hindering terrain and characters, except
			for the square the target occupies.</item>
        <item>MAPS\nHeroClix has three types of maps: outdoor
			maps, indoor maps, and indoor/outdoor maps
			that combine features of both. Each map will be
			labeled as one of these types and game effects
			that behave differently based on whether they are
			indoors or outdoors behave accordingly.
			A map labeled “indoor/outdoor” follows all
			the rules of outdoor maps, except that squares
			inside the yellow boundary line follow all the rules
			of indoor maps. Indoor blocking terrain and indoor
			walls exist at all elevation levels. A wall that borders
			both indoor and outdoor terrain is considered to
			occupy both indoor and outdoor terrain.</item>
        <item>MOVEMENT THROUGH
			INTERSECTION POINTS\nWhenever a character would move diagonally
			through an intersection point between four squares
			on a map, treat the point as the less restrictive terrain
			of the two squares that touch that point not along
			the path of movement. A character moving through
			a hindered intersection point stops movement in the
			square immediately following the point along its path.</item>
        <item>MOVEMENT: STAIRS AND LADDERS\nIf a character has no other means
			to enter and
			leave areas of elevated terrain (such as the Leap/
			Climb power or the Flight ability), it must use stairs
			and ladders. A character can’t “jump off” elevated
			terrain to a different elevation unless a game effect
			allows it to ignore the effects of elevated terrain on
			movement.
			Part of a stairway or ladder is on terrain of a
			lower elevation and part is on terrain of a higher
			elevation. A character must pass through the
			two squares of different elevation to change
			the character’s elevation. On some maps, the 2
			squares of different elevations have numbered
			triangles where the number indicates the level of
			elevation of each side of the red boundary line.
			Characters occupying the two squares through
			which a character can change elevations can make
			close combat attacks against each other as if they
			were adjacent. Stairs and ladders are clear terrain,
			unless there are map boundary lines indicating
			otherwise. Elevated terrain itself has no other effect on
			movement.</item>
        <item>TERRAIN TYPES\nTerrain is the printed landscape of the
			battlefield map; object tokens and 3-D objects; or effects created by
			the use of powers and abilities which involve the placement of
			terrain markers. Terrain affects movement of characters and the
			ability to draw lines of fire.
			HeroClix has five types of terrain: clear, hindering, water, blocking, and
			elevated. All types of terrain (except clear terrain) are indicated
			by boundary lines drawn on the map:\n
			• Squares inside a green boundary line are hindering terrain.\n
			• Squares inside a blue boundary line are water terrain.\n
			• Squares inside a brown boundary line are blocking terrain. Heavy
			black lines running along the grid of the map are walls, which
			function as blocking terrain.\n
			• Squares inside a red boundary line are elevated terrain. Each red
			boundary line has numbers indicating the level of that elevated
			terrain. The larger the number, the higher the elevation. Maps that
			do not indicate an elevation number treat non-elevated terrain as
			level 1 and elevated squares as level 2.\n
			Three other boundary line colors indicate particular areas on a map and
			are clear terrain unless indicated otherwise:\n
			• Squares inside a purple boundary line are a starting area.\n
			• Squares inside a yellow boundary line are interior spaces on an
			indoor/outdoor map.\n
			• Squares inside an orange boundary line have special rules, which are
			explained on the map on which they appear.\n
			Lines indicating specific terrain are drawn just inside the grid marked on
			the map. If a square has a colored boundary line inside of it, the
			square is the type of terrain indicated by the line. If a line can be
			drawn from the center of that square into a second square without
			crossing a boundary line of the same color, the second square is the
			same type of terrain as the first square.
			If a square does not fall inside the boundary of any colored line, it
			is clear terrain. All non-clear terrain is surrounded by a contiguous
			boundary. If a game effect allows for the alteration of terrain,
			boundary lines are assumed to change so that they always form an
			uninterrupted boundary. This may result in a single large section of
			terrain becoming two distinct smaller sections of the same type.
			Squares may be multiple types if they fall within two or more
			boundary lines.
			No game effect can target or attack a character in addition to a piece
			of terrain or object with the same attack, even if they occupy the
			same square.</item>
        <item>WALLS\nWalls are a special type of terrain indicated by heavy
			black lines that run along the map’s grid lines. Walls have no
			boundary lines, but they behave like blocking terrain. Characters on
			opposite sides of walls are not adjacent. The edges of a map are not
			walls.</item>
        <item>WATER TERRAIN\nWater terrain represents features like streams,
			ponds, and other liquids. Water terrain behaves like other terrain
			for movement and line of fire purposes, though it is still a specific
			kind of terrain when considered for anything other than movement or
			line of fire purposes.\n
			• Movement: Water terrain impedes movement, and is hindering terrain
			for movement purposes.\n
			• Line of Fire: Water terrain does not impede line of fire in any way,
			and is clear terrain for line of fire purposes.</item>
        <item>AIRPORT TERMINAL\n
Orange squares are moving walkways. At the beginning of each
turn, each character completely occupying a moving walkway
square that cannot use the Flight ability must be placed in this
area 1 square closer to the thick orange line of this area. This
placement starts with the character closest to the thick orange line.\n
Availability: DC 75</item>
        <item>BATCAVE, THE\n
		    Orange squares are Bat-Pole Squares. If you are also playing
with the Wayne Manor map, you may give a character occupying
this square a power action and place that character in the
corresponding square on that map. If that square is occupied,
place that character in the nearest square it could be placed in.\n
Availability: Batman</item>
        <item>BLACKEST NIGHT STARTER\n
Orange circles designate Monitor Room squares. Whenever a
friendly character occupies a Monitor Room square, all friendly
characters can ignore the effect of hindering terrain and other
characters on line of fire. A character occupying a Monitor Room
square can’t be given ranged combat actions or make ranged
combat attacks.
Squares inside the orange boundary line designate Armory
Squares. When placing objects at the beginning of the game, each
player must place their first two objects (if any) on squares within
an orange boundary line.</item>
        <item>BLACKGATE PRISON\n
		    Orange squares are Bridge terrain. Bridge terrain is elevated
terrain (level 2). Characters occupying grounded terrain that
draw a line of fire to a game element that occupies the same
elevation ignoring the Bridge terrain and anything occupying
Bridge terrain for line of fire purposes. Characters that begin to
move on a lower elevation ignoring the Bridge terrain and
anything occupying Bridge terrain for movement purposes: these
characters cannot end their movement in a square of Bridge
terrain unless they can use a game effect that allows them to
ignore elevation for movement purposes or move through a square
of level 2 terrain immediately prior to moving into Bridge terrain.\n</item>
        <item>BLACKGATE PRISON: POST-CATACLYSM\n
		    Orange squares are Bridge terrain. Bridge terrain is elevated
terrain (level 2). Characters occupying grounded terrain that
draw a line of fire to a game element that occupies the same
elevation ignoring the Bridge terrain and anything occupying
Bridge terrain for line of fire purposes. Characters that begin to
move on a lower elevation ignoring the Bridge terrain and
anything occupying Bridge terrain for movement purposes: these
characters cannot end their movement in a square of Bridge
terrain unless they can use a game effect that allows them to
ignore elevation for movement purposes or move through a square
of level 2 terrain immediately prior to moving into Bridge terrain.\n
Availability: No Man’s Land</item>
        <item>CASTLE DOOM GARDENS\n
Thick orange lines along the grid of this map are force fields. The
effects of this terrain cannot be ignored.
When determining if a line of fire is blocked, treat force fields as
walls. However, force fields are not walls or blocking terrain; they
can’t be destroyed and characters can’t move over or through
them using any power, ability, or effect (such as Phasing/Teleport
or the Flight ability). Characters on opposite sides of force fields
are not adjacent.
When counting squares to determine the range or area of any
effect, you can’t count beyond a force field. (To determine if you
are counting beyond a force field, draw a line from the center of
the square where the effect originates to the square you are
attempting to count; if the line goes through a force field or
through a diagonal bordered on the grid by a force field, the
square can’t be counted.)
Players must choose starting areas diagonally opposite each other,
whenever possible.\n
Availability: Fantastic Four</item>
        <item>CENTRAL PORT\n
Squares inside the boundary of an orange line are transmitter
gates, hacked to echo local gates rather than distant planets! When
any character occupies a transmitter gate at the end of a move or
power action, it may be moved to any other unoccupied transmitter
gate on the map.\n
Availability: Legion of Super-Heroes</item>
        <item>CRATER, THE\n
Orange squares are Fallen Cosmic Object squares. Objects
placed in one of these squares can\'t be picked up, moved, or
destroyed.\n
Availability: Brightest Day</item>
        <item>DAWN OF MAN\n
When this map is played, beginning with the first player, each
player can take a Time Zone (a smaller map section with TIME
ZONE in its name) anywhere within the boundaries of the orange
line on this map. Place Time Zones until up to four Time Zones
have been placed, or until all players agree that no more should be
placed, whichever comes first.
When Time Zones are placed, they may be laid over previously
placed Time Zones, provided that all parts of all Time Zones are
within the boundaries of the orange line. Time Zones must be
aligned with the grid of this map, but may be rotated in any
direction before placement. Once placed, a Time Zone may not be
moved.
Once Time Zones have been placed, a square on the map is the
type of terrain indicated by the topmost map occupying that
square, whether it be this map of a Time Zone. If an area of terrain
on any map is interrupted by a map overlaid upon it, its
boundaries are assumed to move to the nearest adjacent square or
squares of that type of terrain so that all squares are contained
within a continuous boundary; in some cases this may result in
multiple separate areas of terrain.\n
Availability: Crisis</item>
        <item>DEEP SPACE\n
Squares inside the boundary of an orange line on this map are
space terrain. Space terrain is clear terrain modified by the
following rules:
Characters given move actions when they occupy space terrain
modify their speed values by +2 for the action. Halve the range
values of all characters occupying space terrain and all characters
drawing a line of fire to a character occupying space terrain.
A successful attack that does not otherwise knock back a character
occupying space terrain knocks back that character a number of
squares equal to damage dealt -2, to a minimum of 0. When
targeting a character occupying space terrain with Force Blast,
roll two six-sided dice instead of one. All knock back ends
immediately when a character enters the first square that is not
space terrain. Characters occupying space terrain are not dealt
knock back damage if their knock back paths are ended by the edge
of the map.\n

		    Docking Port Attack: A character occupying an orange square can
make a ranged attack as if they occupied any square marked with
an X, had a 6 #lightning# range (instead of their printed range value), and
the Sharpshooter ability. After the attack is resolved, roll 2d6 and
add the number of occupied orange squares (including the one
occupied by the character): if the result is 9 or more, deal the
character 1 unavoidable damage.\n
